This directory contains the jar file of the Ensemble8 application, which demonstrates many of the javafx features,
along with the required scripts to create an Android package based on
this application.

1. Build the JavaFX Application.
The Ensemble8.jar can be build from the sources files of the javafx android sdk, if you execute the gradle apps target.
For your convenience a prebuild jar file is provided in the ensemble directory.

2. Create an Android project based on the JavaFX Application.
The rootdirectory for this sample contains a script named
convertJavaFXToAndroid.sh.
You have to change 1 parameter in this file: 
ANDROID_SDK should point to the directory where you downloaded the
android sdk. After changing the parameter, run the convertJavaFXToAndroid.sh script

Note: a Windows version of this script will be added in a later release.
For now, Windows users should change the script into a .bat file

The result of this step is a directory named android/Ensemble8Android 
If you try to do this step twice, you will get an error since the 
directory already exist. Remove the directory and try again.

3. Build the Android package.
cd into the android/Ensemble8Android directory and run
ant clean debug

This will create a package Ensemble8Android-debug.apk in the android/Ensemble8Android/bin directory.
This package can now be transfered to your android device using
/path/to/ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb install bin/Ensemble8Android-debug.apk
